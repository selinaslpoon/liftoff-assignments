In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Habit Tracker App will help the user keep track of how well they are sticking to their daily/weekly/monthly habits. This application will allow users to create personalised habit lists and set the frequency of these habits, then they can check off each habit as they complete them. The idea of this project came from the need to keep on top of daily routines and also can be used to check when the last time I watered a plant or changed the air filter. It can also be used when sharing habits with partners or roommates, for example, a habit (or chore) can be assigned to a particular user.

### Features
- User login: Users will be able to create an account and login to their account. Users will have their own personalised tracker screen.
- Add habit: Users will be able to create, edit and delete habits.
- Complete a habit: Users will be able to check off each habit once completed.
- Reminders/Alerts: Users can sync habit reminders with Google/Apple calendar?
- Shared Habits: Users can share joint habits with other users. Users can 'assign' habits to other users.

- Users can change the view of their tracker (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
